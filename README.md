**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

Performed using Python (Pandas):
Removed missing and duplicate values
Corrected data types (dates, integers, floats)
Handled outliers
Created derived columns for analysis
Normalized and standardized data where required



**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Summary statistics
Trend analysis
Category-wise distribution
Time-based analysis
Correlation checks



**SQL Analysis**

Created relational tables
Applied JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE, and subqueries
Performed aggregations and KPI calculations
Optimized queries for performance

Example SQL Queries:
Monthly trends
Customer segmentation
Performance metrics



**Power BI Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard includes:
KPI cards
Bar charts & line charts
Filters and slicers
Trend and comparison views
